My attmept to implement a load balancer in GO.
I am doing this as I am getting into learning GO and distributed systems, so I thought it be a good way to get good at both the concepts and the language.

## TODO

<!-- These TODOs were generated by AI, I might not implement them all but I'll do my best over time -->

- [ ] Write a blog maybe, in parts or one blog and add link here.
- [x] Create mock servers
- [x] Create round robin algo
- [ ] Implement Weighted round robin or Least connections algo
- [ ] Have a NGINX like config file
  - [x] parse server data from the config
  - [ ] parse balancer data from the config
- [ ] Add a health check
- [ ] Add a retry mechanism
- [ ] Add a rate limiter (I've built one at [here](https://github.com/ShubhamVerma1811/rate-limiter-go-redis), maybe I can use it here)
- [ ] Better logging
